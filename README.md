# Cpp-Console-Calculator

#### This program is a scientific calculator that can do algebra, calculus, and a lot more.
> #### For now, the Calculator can only be run on windows, but it will be available on the web after some time.

## What can the calculator do?
This version of the calculator can only be run in the **Windows Terminal** (command line), so it has no graphical interface. Because of this, it is unnecessary for the calculator to be able to graph functions or do anythign else that would give the user some sort of visual feedback, so that sort of thing is not included. However, I am planning to make a version that uses a graphical interface and things that do require visual feedback will be included there. If there is a mathematical problem where a text-based solution is enough, this calculator will probably have it.

## Development
This calculator was programmed in **C++** using the *Visual Studio IDE* (MSVC).<br>
The whole thing was meant to be a practice project at first, but then I thoght it would be fun to go through with making it an actual project. I would say that was a good decision since I learned a lot of C++ from making this calculator.
